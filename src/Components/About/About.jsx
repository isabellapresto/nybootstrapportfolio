            Hi!</p><p> My name is Isabella. I am a driven web developer student studying the program "Web developer in e-commerce" at Medieinstitutet (graduating in May).
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now looking for an internship during the period 2024/02/05 - 2024/05/17.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my education at Medieinstitutet, I have learned about and worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Node.js, Express, React, API-development and development for WordPress, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really enjoy working with React and am now learning more about Bootstrap. I like both front and backend development but am leaning a bit more towards  frontend. I'm looking for an internship where I can apply what I have learned during my education, learn more about web development, and grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm based in Barcelona but open to work remotely worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Best, <br/>
            Isabella
